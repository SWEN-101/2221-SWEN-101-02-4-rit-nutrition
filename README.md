# Project Name: nutRITion
# Modify this document to expand any and all sections that are applicable for a better understanding from your users/testers/collaborators (remove this comment and other instructions areas for your FINAL release)

nutRITion is an app designed for RIT staff and students to help users find and plan healthy meals at RIT. A common complaint is that RIT doesn’t offer much healthy food, and at first glance, that can seem true. nutRITion aims to help users easily find where healthy options are and help them build a plan. RIT’s existing resources (such as NetNutrition) don’t do the best job and are overly complicated.

nutRITion can also help users seeking a more specific diet, such as one with a lot of protein, one that is very low calorie, or one that is organic, filter the available options to better fit their desires. nutRITion will also help you find options that are convenient near you, which is especially useful if you’re trying to find a quick bite in between classes. Or it can show you the furthest options, if you feel like getting a good walk in.
